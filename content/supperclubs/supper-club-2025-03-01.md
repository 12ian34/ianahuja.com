no structure. no forced fun. no intros or interesting facts. just come along, chill, eat good food and maybe connect with some interesting people.

whilst not fully vegetarian, there'll be enough great veg options available and it won't be just salad!

---

no need to bring anything, but people tend to bring their own drinks

there may be more registrations than seats available. i personally know most of the people invited, and i try to curate, so, rather than first come first serve, it's vibe-based. i'll try to be fair. if you register but aren't confirmed, then you'll be priority for the next one.
