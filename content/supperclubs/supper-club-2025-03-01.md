some more menu details are coming soon‚Ä¶

there may be more registrations than seats available

i make an attempt to curate the supper clubs to optimise for interesting chats and connections

so rather than first come first serve, it's vibe-based, and i try to be fair

if you register but aren't confirmed, then you'll be priority for the next supper club

whilst not fully vegetarian, there'll be enough great veg options available and it won't be just salad!

no need to bring anything, but people tend to bring their own alcoholic drinks and that's cool. there might be some alcoholic drinks provided, but the focus is on the food

there is no structure. you won't be forced to introduce yourself or tell an interesting fact. just come along, chill, eat good food and maybe connect with some interesting people
