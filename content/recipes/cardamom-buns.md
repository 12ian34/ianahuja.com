## dough ingredients

- 600g white bread flour
- 110g caster sugar
- 1 tsp fine salt
- 14g instant dried yeast
- 375ml milk, warmed to 37°C
- 60g unsalted butter, softened

## filling ingredients

- 100g unsalted butter, softened
- 110g granulated sugar
- 2-4 tsp ground cardamom seeds
- 1/4 tsp fine salt

## topping ingredients

- 1 egg, beaten with splash of water
- 3 tbsp granulated sugar
- 2-4 tsp ground cardamom seeds

## instructions

### dough

1. measure the flour, sugar, salt and yeast into the bowl of an electric stand mixer
2. lightly mix the ingredients together using the dough hook
3. slowly pour in the warm milk, and continue mixing until everything comes together into a rough dough
4. add the butter, one tablespoon at a time. once the butter has been fully incorporated into the dough, add the next tablespoon of butter
5. once all of the butter has been added, continue kneading the dough on medium speed for about 15 to 20 minutes
6. the dough is ready when it is soft and smooth, and no longer sticks to the side of the bowl. the dough will be somewhat sticky from the butter

### first proof

1. lightly oil a large mixing bowl
2. place the dough inside the bowl
3. cover the dough with a clean tea towel, plastic wrap, or a reusable bowl cover
4. leave the dough somewhere warm for 1 to 1.5 hours, or until the dough has doubled in size

### filling

1. just before the dough has finished the first proofing period, make the filling by beating together the ingredients

### roll out dough

1. once the dough has doubled in size, gently remove the dough from the bowl. the dough will deflate as you handle it
2. roll out the dough into a rectangle shape measuring approximately 40 x 30 cm
3. use a small palette knife to evenly spread the cardamom-sugar filling all over the dough
4. fold over one-third of the dough towards the centre, and overlap with the other third of the dough
5. use a rolling pin to gently flatten the dough and smooth out any air bubbles. aim to have a rectangle shape measuring approximately 30 x 15 cm
6. cut the dough into strips measuring 2 cm wide. how many strips you cut will depend on how wide you have rolled your dough, but you should get about 12-15 strips

### shape buns

1. take one strip of dough and twist it gently with both hands, slightly stretching the dough as you do so
2. for right-handers: start wrapping the twisted dough around three of your fingers in your left hand
3. finish the knot by tucking the end of the dough into the centre of the bun on top

### second proof

1. line a large baking pan with baking paper
2. arrange the shaped buns on the lined baking pan. space the buns apart generously
3. place the pan somewhere warm for about 30 minutes, or until the buns have risen and puffed up slightly
4. during this time, preheat the oven to 200°C (without fan) with a metal baking tray on the middle shelf

### bake

1. gently brush each bun with some egg wash
2. mix together the sugar and freshly ground cardamom
3. sprinkle each bun with some of the cardamom-sugar
4. place the pan of buns on the preheated baking tray
5. bake the buns for about 20 minutes, or until the buns are lightly golden. check the buns at about 10 minutes, and if they are browning too quickly, cover them with a loose sheet of foil for the rest of the baking time
6. the buns are cooked if an internal thermometer reads 85°C
7. gently remove the buns to a wire rack, and leave them to cool completely
